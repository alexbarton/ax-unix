ax-unix: Alex' UNIX Tools & Scripts
Copyright (c)2013-2017 Alexander Barton (alex@barton.de)

This directory contains library files to use in 3rd party applications and
scripts. Please see below for usage information.


ax-common.sh
------------

This is a shell script library containing common useful functions. If you want
to use it in your own code, your script must include ("source") this library
file, and therefore it has to check some common locations (if you don't bundle
it in some other ways and exactly know the location it is installed in).

Use something like the following in your scrips:

----> cut here <---------------------------------------------------------------
# Include "ax-common.sh":
ax_common_sourced=
for dir in "$HOME/lib" "$HOME/.ax" /usr/local /opt/ax /usr; do
	[ -z "$ax_common_sourced" ] || break
	ax_common="${dir}/lib/ax/ax-common.sh"
	# shellcheck source=/usr/local/lib/ax/ax-common.sh
	[ -r "$ax_common" ] && . "$ax_common"
done
if [ -z "$ax_common_sourced" ]; then
	echo "Error ($(basename "$0")): \"ax-common.sh\" not found, aborting!" >&2
	echo "Please install 'ax-unix', \"Alex' UNIX Tools & Scripts\", and try again."
	exit 99
fi
unset dir ax_common ax_common_sourced
----> cut here <---------------------------------------------------------------
